# Analysis
(by SolSaver)

## Hours Spent: 15

## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
Started by reading the design document in the repository.
Then started to go contract by contract.

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
I learnt a lot about Governance and Arbitrum. I am motivated to go through rest of their codebase.

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
I couldn't spend much time on this audit, so the report is a little dry, and hence the basic analysis.
