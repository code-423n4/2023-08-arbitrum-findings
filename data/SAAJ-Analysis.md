# Approach
The approach i taken for assessing the Arbitrum Security Council Election System is going through the Arbitrum official documentation which include Dao governance, and Arbitrum Constitution. The documentation helps in understanding the flow of the council how the election process will be carried out.
Then i started taking a line-by-line approach for reviewing all the contracts in scope first for optimisation and low severity issues.

# Learning
My learning from this contest is to used different resources including past audit reports for understanding effective design patterns and identifying common mistakes that can lead to issues in the project that can be exploited.

# Comments
My findings related to gas optimisation are related to design patterns which cause expensive gas cost for the project.
Low severity findings focus on issues that need improvement for better control and operations to be carried out smoothly by every user.
My contribution should be considered in area of improving the design flow of the project in context of gas efficiency and control enhancement.
