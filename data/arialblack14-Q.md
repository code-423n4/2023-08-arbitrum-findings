### [N-2] `_swapMembers` function does not check if the member to swap is the same.

The function `swapMembers` does not check whether the member to remove is the same one that is being added, thus creating unnecessary costs for the user [src](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilManager.sol#L218-L229).

#### Vulnerability details

```solidity
    function _swapMembers(address _addressToRemove, address _addressToAdd)
        internal
        returns (Cohort)
    {
        if (_addressToRemove == address(0) || _addressToAdd == address(0)) {
            revert ZeroAddress();
        }
        Cohort cohort = _removeMemberFromCohortArray(_addressToRemove);
        _addMemberToCohortArray(_addressToAdd, cohort);
        _scheduleUpdate();
        return cohort;
    }
```

#### Recommendation

Add the following check:
```solidity
if (_addressToRemove == _addressToAdd) {
     revert SameAddress();
}
```

### [N-3] Unnecessary addresses array creation

The function `filterAddressesWithExcludeList` creates an unnecessary `output` array of addresses in memory costing extra gas and adding complexity.[src](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMgmtUtils.sol#L15-L36)

#### Vulnerability details

```solidity
    function filterAddressesWithExcludeList(
        address[] memory input,
        mapping(address => bool) storage excludeList
    ) internal view returns (address[] memory) {
        address[] memory intermediate = new address[](input.length);
        uint256 intermediateLength = 0;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
            address nominee = input[i];
            if (!excludeList[nominee]) {
                intermediate[intermediateLength] = nominee;
                intermediateLength++;
            }
        }

        address[] memory output = new address[](intermediateLength);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < intermediateLength; i++) {
            output[i] = intermediate[i];
        }

        return output;
    }
```

#### Recommendation

Remove either `intermediate` or `output`.

### [N-4] Duplicate checks in the `_countVote` function 

In the function above there is a check that is duplicated costing unnecessary gas and adding repetition.

#### Vulnerability details

[src](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L121-L127)

```solidity
        uint256 prevVotesUsed = election.votesUsed[account];
        if (prevVotesUsed + votes > availableVotes) {
            revert InsufficientVotes(prevVotesUsed, votes, availableVotes);
        }

        uint240 prevWeightReceived = election.weightReceived[nominee];
        election.votesUsed[account] = prevVotesUsed + votes;
```

#### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
        uint256 prevVotesUsed = election.votesUsed[account];
++      uint256 totalVotesUsed = prevVotesUsed + votes;
++      if (totalVotesUsed > availableVotes) {
--      if (prevVotesUsed + votes > availableVotes) {
            revert InsufficientVotes(prevVotesUsed, votes, availableVotes);
        }

        uint240 prevWeightReceived = election.weightReceived[nominee];
--      election.votesUsed[account] = prevVotesUsed + votes;
++      election.votesUsed[account] = totalVotesUsed;
```

### [N-5] Unsafe `_downCast` function

The function `_downCast` may revert if the users' votes are too large [src](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L259C1-L264C6). 

#### Vulnerability details

This is highly unlikely but will revert if the votes ever reach such a high value.

```solidity
    function _downCast(uint256 x) internal pure returns (uint240) {
        if (x > type(uint240).max) {
            revert UintTooLarge(x);
        }
        return uint240(x);
    }
```

#### Recommendation

Consider reverting in such a case instead of downcasting.
