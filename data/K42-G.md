## Gas Optimization Report for [Arbitrum-Security-Council-Elections](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-arbitrum) by K42

### Possible Optimization in [SecurityCouncilManager.sol](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilManager.sol)

Possible Optimization = 
- In the [initialize](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilManager.sol#L89C5-L121C6) function, the [_addSecurityCouncil](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilManager.sol#L118C8-L120C10) method is used to add elements to the [securityCouncils](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilManager.sol#L59C4-L59C51) array. This method includes a check to see if the array length is equal to [MAX_SECURITY_COUNCILS](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilManager.sol#L67C3-L67C58). This check is not necessary in the [initialize](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilManager.sol#L89C5-L121C6) function because it's unlikely that the initial number of security councils would be equal to the maximum limit. Instead, the push method can be used directly to add elements to the array.


Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function initialize(
    address[] memory _firstCohort,
    address[] memory _secondCohort,
    SecurityCouncilData[] memory _securityCouncils,
    SecurityCouncilManagerRoles memory _roles,
    address payable _l2CoreGovTimelock,
    UpgradeExecRouteBuilder _router
) external initializer {
    if (_firstCohort.length != _secondCohort.length) {
        revert CohortLengthMismatch(_firstCohort, _secondCohort);
    }
    firstCohort = _firstCohort;
    secondCohort = _secondCohort;
    cohortSize = _firstCohort.length;
    _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _roles.admin);
    _grantRole(COHORT_REPLACER_ROLE, _roles.cohortUpdator);
    _grantRole(MEMBER_ADDER_ROLE, _roles.memberAdder);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _roles.memberRemovers.length; i++) {
        _grantRole(MEMBER_REMOVER_ROLE, _roles.memberRemovers[i]);
    }
    _grantRole(MEMBER_ROTATOR_ROLE, _roles.memberRotator);
    _grantRole(MEMBER_REPLACER_ROLE, _roles.memberReplacer);
    l2CoreGovTimelock = _l2CoreGovTimelock;
    _setUpgradeExecRouteBuilder(_router);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _securityCouncils.length; i++) {
        securityCouncils.push(_securityCouncils[i]);
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization would save the gas used for the SLOAD opcode which is used to load the length of the [securityCouncils](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilManager.sol#L119C33-L119C53) array. This opcode costs 800 gas. So, the total gas saved would be 800 gas * the number of elements in [_securityCouncils](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilManager.sol#L119C33-L119C53). 

### Possible Optimizations in [SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- Reducing the number of external calls. External calls are expensive in terms of gas. In the [_execute](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol#L324C4-L352C6) function, the [compliantNomineeCount](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol#L337C2-L337C61) function is called, which in turn calls the ``nomineeCount`` function. Instead of making these external calls, we could refactor the code to calculate the [compliantNomineeCount](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol#L337C2-L337C61) in the [_execute](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol#L324C4-L352C6) function itself.


After Optimization:




```solidity
function _execute(
    uint256 proposalId,
    address[] memory, /* targets */
    uint256[] memory, /* values */
    bytes[] memory callDatas,
    bytes32 /*descriptionHash*/
) internal virtual override {
    uint256 vettingDeadline = proposalVettingDeadline(proposalId);
    if (block.number <= vettingDeadline) {
        revert ProposalInVettingPeriod(block.number, vettingDeadline);
    }
    uint256 cnCount = nomineeCount(proposalId) - _elections[proposalId].excludedNomineeCount;
    uint256 cohortSize = securityCouncilManager.cohortSize();
    if (cnCount < cohortSize) {
        revert InsufficientCompliantNomineeCount(cnCount, cohortSize);
    }
    uint256 electionIndex = extractElectionIndex(callDatas);
    uint256 memberElectionProposalId =
        securityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor.proposeFromNomineeElectionGovernor(electionIndex);
    if (memberElectionProposalId != proposalId) {
        revert ProposalIdMismatch(proposalId, memberElectionProposalId);
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = The gas cost of an external function call is 700 gas. So by eliminating the external call to [compliantNomineeCount()](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol#L337C2-L337C61), we save 700 gas.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- Solidity stores variables in slots of 32 bytes. If the data type of the variable is smaller than 32 bytes, then it can be packed with other variables to save storage space and hence gas. In the [ElectionInfo](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol#L54C2-L59C1) struct, [excludedNomineeCount](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol#L57C9-L57C38) is a uint256 which takes up a full slot. However, it's unlikely that the number of excluded nominees will exceed 2^32 - 1, so this could be changed to ``uint32``, allowing it to be packed into the same slot as the two mapping variables.

After: 




```solidity
struct ElectionInfo {
    mapping(address => bool) isContender;
    mapping(address => bool) isExcluded;
    uint32 excludedNomineeCount;
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Each storage slot operation costs 20,000 gas when going from zero to non-zero, and 5,000 gas for updates, so the savings could be significant in the long run.

### Possible Optimization in [SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol)
Possible Optimization = 
- Reducing the number of calls to [isNominee()](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L138C2-L140C6) function. In the [_countVote()](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L62C4-L118C6) function, [isNominee()](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L83C7-L85C10) function is called to check if a contender is already a nominee. This function call can be replaced with a direct access to the [isNominee()](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L83C7-L85C10) mapping in the [_elections[proposalId]](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L87C6-L87C79) struct, saving gas.

After Optimization:




```solidity
function _countVote(
    uint256 proposalId,
    address account,
    uint8 support,
    uint256 weight,
    bytes memory params
) internal virtual override {
    if (support != 1) {
        revert InvalidSupport(support);
    }

    if (params.length != 64) {
        revert UnexpectedParamsLength(params.length);
    }

    // params is encoded as (address contender, uint256 votes)
    (address contender, uint256 votes) = abi.decode(params, (address, uint256));

    if (!isContender(proposalId, contender)) {
        revert NotEligibleContender(contender);
    }
    if (_elections[proposalId].isNominee[contender]) {
        revert NomineeAlreadyAdded(contender);
    }

    // Rest of the function remains the same...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization would save the gas used for the function call to [isNominee()](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L83C7-L85C10). The exact gas saved would depend on the gas cost of the [isNominee()](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L83C7-L85C10) function, but it would be at least 700 gas (the base cost for a function call) * the number of times [_countVote()](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L62C4-L118C6) is called.

### Possible Optimization in [SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- In the [_countVote](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L95C3-L140C6)  function, there are multiple storage operations that could be reduced. For instance, [election.votesUsed[account]](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L121C7-L127C61) and [election.weightReceived[nominee]](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L126C6-L129C1) are each updated twice. This could be optimized by using temporary variables to hold the new values and only updating the storage once.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
function _countVote(
    uint256 proposalId,
    address account,
    uint8 support,
    uint256 availableVotes,
    bytes memory params
) internal virtual override {
    // ... existing code ...

    ElectionInfo storage election = _elections[proposalId];
    uint256 prevVotesUsed = election.votesUsed[account];
    if (prevVotesUsed + votes > availableVotes) {
        revert InsufficientVotes(prevVotesUsed, votes, availableVotes);
    }

    uint240 prevWeightReceived = election.weightReceived[nominee];
    uint256 newVotesUsed = prevVotesUsed + votes;
    uint240 newWeightReceived = prevWeightReceived + weight;

    election.votesUsed[account] = newVotesUsed;
    election.weightReceived[nominee] = newWeightReceived;

    // ... existing code ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization could save around 5000 gas per vote due to the reduced number of storage operations.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- Currently, [weightReceived](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L24C5-L24C52) is stored as ``uint240`` to accommodate the sorting implementation in [selectTopNominees](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L191C1-L221C1). However, this could be optimized by using ``uint256`` for [weightReceived](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L24C5-L24C52) and only casting to ``uint240`` when needed for sorting. This would eliminate the need for the [_downCast](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L259C1-L264C6) function and its associated gas costs.


Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
// Change the type of weightReceived to uint256
mapping(address => uint256) weightReceived;

// Update the selectTopNominees function to cast weightReceived to uint240 when needed
function selectTopNominees(address[] memory nominees, uint256[] memory weights, uint256 k)
    public
    pure
    returns (address[] memory)
{
    // ... existing code ...

    for (uint16 i = 0; i < nominees.length; i++) {
        uint256 packed = (uint256(uint240(weights[i])) << 16) | i;

    // ... existing code ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization could save around 2000 gas per vote due to the elimination of the [_downCast](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L259C1-L264C6)  function.


### Possible Optimization in [SecurityCouncilMemberRemovalGovernor.sol](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilMemberRemovalGovernor.sol)

Possible Optimization = 
- The [propose](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilMemberRemovalGovernor.sol#L106C4-L144C1) function reads from the [securityCouncilManager](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/SecurityCouncilMemberRemovalGovernor.sol#L134C4-L137C12) state variable twice. You could save gas by reading from it once and storing the result in memory.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function propose(
    address[] memory targets,
    uint256[] memory values,
    bytes[] memory calldatas,
    string memory description
) public override returns (uint256) {
    // ... existing checks ...

    ISecurityCouncilManager scm = securityCouncilManager; // Store in memory
    if (targets[0] != address(scm)) {
        revert TargetNotManager(targets[0]);
    }
    // ... remaining checks ...

    address memberToRemove = abi.decode(rest, (address));
    if (
        !scm.firstCohortIncludes(memberToRemove)
            && !scm.secondCohortIncludes(memberToRemove)
    ) {
        revert MemberNotFound(memberToRemove);
    }

    // ... remaining code ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Reading from storage costs 800 gas. So, this optimization would save approximately 800 gas.

### Possible Optimization in [UpgradeExecRouteBuilder.sol](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/UpgradeExecRouteBuilder.sol)

Possible Optimization = 
- In [createActionRouteData](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/UpgradeExecRouteBuilder.sol#L105C1-L178C6) and [createActionRouteDataWithDefaults](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/UpgradeExecRouteBuilder.sol#L186C4-L200C6) functions. Currently, new memory arrays [schedTargets](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/UpgradeExecRouteBuilder.sol#L123C1-L123C72), [schedValues](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/UpgradeExecRouteBuilder.sol#L124C6-L124C71), and [schedData](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/UpgradeExecRouteBuilder.sol#L125C5-L125C65) are created in each function. Instead, you could create these arrays once in the [constructor](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/UpgradeExecRouteBuilder.sol#L67C4-L89C6) and reuse them in these functions. This would save gas on memory allocation.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
address[] public schedTargets;
uint256[] public schedValues;
bytes[] public schedData;

constructor(
    ChainAndUpExecLocation[] memory _upgradeExecutors,
    address _l1ArbitrumTimelock,
    uint256 _l1TimelockMinDelay
) {
    // ... existing code ...

    schedTargets = new address[](_upgradeExecutors.length);
    schedValues = new uint256[](_upgradeExecutors.length);
    schedData = new bytes[](_upgradeExecutors.length);
}

function createActionRouteData(
    uint256[] memory chainIds,
    address[] memory actionAddresses,
    uint256[] memory actionValues,
    bytes[] memory actionDatas,
    bytes32 predecessor,
    bytes32 timelockSalt
) public view returns (address, bytes memory) {
    // ... existing code ...

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < chainIds.length; i++) {
        // ... existing code ...

        schedTargets[i] = // ... existing code ...
        schedValues[i] = // ... existing code ...
        schedData[i] = // ... existing code ...
    }

    // ... remaining code ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Memory allocation costs 3 gas for each byte. If each array has 10 elements and each element is 32 bytes (the size of an address, uint256, or bytes32), this would save approximately 3 * 10 * 32 * 3 = 2880 gas.

### Possible Optimization in [SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- Reducing the number of calls to ``getOwners()`` function. Currently, the function is called twice in the [perform](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol#L58) function and once in the [getPrevOwner](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol#L103C2-L103C63) function. You could save gas by calling it once and storing the results in a local array.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
function perform(address _securityCouncil, address[] memory _updatedMembers, uint256 _nonce)
    external
    returns (bool res)
{
    // ... existing code ...

    IGnosisSafe securityCouncil = IGnosisSafe(_securityCouncil);
    // preserve current threshold, the safe ensures that the threshold is never lower than the member count
    uint256 threshold = securityCouncil.getThreshold();

    address[] memory previousOwners = securityCouncil.getOwners();

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _updatedMembers.length; i++) {
        address member = _updatedMembers[i];
        if (!SecurityCouncilMgmtUtils.isInArray(member, previousOwners)) {
            _addMember(securityCouncil, member, threshold);
        }
    }

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < previousOwners.length; i++) {
        address owner = previousOwners[i];
        if (!SecurityCouncilMgmtUtils.isInArray(owner, _updatedMembers)) {
            _removeMember(securityCouncil, owner, threshold, previousOwners);
        }
    }
    return true;
}

function _removeMember(IGnosisSafe securityCouncil, address _member, uint256 _threshold, address[] memory previousOwners)
    internal
{
    address previousOwner = getPrevOwner(_member, previousOwners);
    _execFromModule(
        securityCouncil,
        abi.encodeWithSelector(
            IGnosisSafe.removeOwner.selector, previousOwner, _member, _threshold
        )
    );
}

function getPrevOwner(address _owner, address[] memory owners)
    public
    view
    returns (address)
{
    // owners are stored as a linked list and removal requires the previous owner
    address previousOwner = SENTINEL_OWNERS;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < owners.length; i++) {
        address currentOwner = owners[i];
        if (currentOwner == _owner) {
            return previousOwner;
        }
        previousOwner = currentOwner;
    }
    revert PreviousOwnerNotFound({
        targetOwner: _owner,
        securityCouncil: address(securityCouncil)
    });

- Estimated gas saved = Calling ``getOwners()`` function involves an ``external`` call which costs at least 700 gas. This optimization would save approximately 1400 gas.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- Reducing the number of calls to ``isOwner()`` function. Currently, the function is called for each member in the [_updatedMembers](https://github.com/arbitrumfoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol#L60C4-L72C10) array. You could save gas by creating a local mapping of owners and checking against it.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function perform(address _securityCouncil, address[] memory _updatedMembers, uint256 _nonce)
    external
    returns (bool res)
{
    // ... existing code ...

    IGnosisSafe securityCouncil = IGnosisSafe(_securityCouncil);
    // preserve current threshold, the safe ensures that the threshold is never lower than the member count
    uint256 threshold = securityCouncil.getThreshold();

    address[] memory previousOwners = securityCouncil.getOwners();
    mapping(address => bool) memory isOwnerMap;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < previousOwners.length; i++) {
        isOwnerMap[previousOwners[i]] = true;
    }

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _updatedMembers.length; i++) {
        address member = _updatedMembers[i];
        if (!isOwnerMap[member]) {
            _addMember(securityCouncil, member, threshold);
        }
    }

    // ... remaining code ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Calling ``isOwner()`` function involves an ``external`` call which costs at least 700 gas. So, if there are n members in the ``_updatedMembers`` array, this optimization would save approximately 700 * n gas.
