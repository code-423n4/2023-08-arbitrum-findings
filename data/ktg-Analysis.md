### My approach in evaluating the codebase
- I focus on 4 main contracts forming the election process, which is `SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol`,  `SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor.sol`,`SecurityCouncilMemberRemovalGovernor.sol` and `SecurityCouncilManager.sol`. I read documents from the forum post https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-security-council-elections-proposed-implementation-spec/15425/ and Arbitrum constitution https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution to find if anything not complied. 
- I also observe how the election pass through the above 4 contracts and see if any vulnerabilities in processing the elections, nominees, contenders,...

### Centralization risks and some recommendations
Here are some architecture/centralizations riks/recommendations I think should improve the overall security of the codebase:
- `SecurityCouncilManager` should not assign `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. The needed roles are `MEMBER_REPLACER_ROLE`, `COHORT_REPLACER_ROLE`, `MEMBER_ROTATOR_ROLE`, `MEMBER_REMOVER_ROLE`, `MEMBER_ADDER_ROLE`. I think we should make new admin roles for each of these roles and grant those admin roles to either the `admin` addresses because with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role, the `admin` can just create new roles and assign it to anyone. Another way of doing this is to grant the admin roles of necessary roles to different addresses, not just admin, that will make the admin less powerful.
- I think some configuration related to elections should be updated only if no election is running. For example, the `quorumNumerator` could be updated any time and that will greatly affect the running election.


### Some thoughts on Arbitrum Security Council Election System security:
- I think the protocol did a really good job in managing the flow of election, from contender application, nominee selection, member election to the actual cohort replacement. I can find no weakness related to the flow itself or the interactions between steps in the flow.
- The time duration measurement is a little bit tricky for the developer i think, because the specification always states things like `the length for nominee selection is X days,...`, but the contracts uses openzeppelin's `Governor`, which uses block.number to measure durations. There is no way to make these durations exactly like in specification, because the number of blocks per day is not constant. The best thing we can do is to update these durations based on up-to-date blocks per day number.
- The contracts often lacks of input checking/sanitization; I think the assumption here is that we can just authorized users to initialize contract, call authorized functions. However, additional checks is necessary to minimize human errors.
- The authorized users usually have too much power; for example a nominee vetter can arbitrarily exclude/include any nominee they want, they basically controls the list of nominees to submit to member election and can block elections if they want to (by creating an invalid list of nominees so that the subsequent steps will fail)
