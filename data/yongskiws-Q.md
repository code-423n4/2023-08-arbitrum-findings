### 1. consider some validation statements used in constructors to check the given input before those values ​​are used in variable initialization

```solidity
@audit as an example
require(_emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold > 0, "Emergency threshold must be greater than zero");
require(_nonEmergencySecurityCouncilThreshold > 0, "Non-emergency threshold must be greater than zero");
require(_securityCouncilManager != address(0), "Security council manager address cannot be zero");

GovernanceChainSCMgmtActivationAction.sol
27:     constructor(
28:         IGnosisSafe _newEmergencySecurityCouncil,
29:         IGnosisSafe _newNonEmergencySecurityCouncil,
30:         IGnosisSafe _prevEmergencySecurityCouncil,
31:         IGnosisSafe _prevNonEmergencySecurityCouncil,
32:         uint256 _emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold,
33:         uint256 _nonEmergencySecurityCouncilThreshold,
34:         address _securityCouncilManager,
35:         IL2AddressRegistry _l2AddressRegistry
36:     ) {
37: 
38: 
39:         newEmergencySecurityCouncil = _newEmergencySecurityCouncil;
40:         newNonEmergencySecurityCouncil = _newNonEmergencySecurityCouncil;
41: 
42:         prevEmergencySecurityCouncil = _prevEmergencySecurityCouncil;
43:         prevNonEmergencySecurityCouncil = _prevNonEmergencySecurityCouncil;
44: 
45:         emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold = _emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold;
46:         nonEmergencySecurityCouncilThreshold = _nonEmergencySecurityCouncilThreshold;
47: 
48:         securityCouncilManager = _securityCouncilManager;
49:         l2AddressRegistry = _l2AddressRegistry;
50:     }

@audit as an example

require(_newEmergencySecurityCouncil != address(0), "New emergency security council address cannot be zero");
require(_prevEmergencySecurityCouncil != address(0), "Previous emergency security council address cannot be zero");
require(address(_l1UpgradeExecutor) != address(0), "L1 upgrade executor address cannot be zero");
require(address(_l1Timelock) != address(0), "L1 timelock address cannot be zero");
require(_emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold > 0, "Emergency security council threshold must be greater than zero");


L1SCMgmtActivationAction.sol
18:     constructor(
19:         IGnosisSafe _newEmergencySecurityCouncil,
20:         IGnosisSafe _prevEmergencySecurityCouncil,
21:         uint256 _emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold,
22:         IUpgradeExecutor _l1UpgradeExecutor,
23:         ICoreTimelock _l1Timelock
24:     ) {
25:         newEmergencySecurityCouncil = _newEmergencySecurityCouncil;
26:         prevEmergencySecurityCouncil = _prevEmergencySecurityCouncil;
27:         emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold = _emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold;
28:         l1UpgradeExecutor = _l1UpgradeExecutor;
29:         l1Timelock = _l1Timelock;
30:     }


@audit as an example
require(_newEmergencySecurityCouncil != address(0), "New emergency security council address cannot be zero");
require(_prevEmergencySecurityCouncil != address(0), "Previous emergency security council address cannot be zero");
require(address(_upgradeExecutor) != address(0), "Upgrade executor address cannot be zero");
require(_emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold > 0, "Emergency security council threshold must be greater than zero");


    constructor(
        IGnosisSafe _newEmergencySecurityCouncil,
        IGnosisSafe _prevEmergencySecurityCouncil,
        uint256 _emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold,
        IUpgradeExecutor _upgradeExecutor
    ) {
        newEmergencySecurityCouncil = _newEmergencySecurityCouncil;
        prevEmergencySecurityCouncil = _prevEmergencySecurityCouncil;
        emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold = _emergencySecurityCouncilThreshold;
        upgradeExecutor = _upgradeExecutor;
    }

```


### 2. missing zero check

``` solidity
@audit as an example
require(_nomineeVetter != address(0), "Nominee vetter address cannot be zero");

SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol
246:     function setNomineeVetter(address _nomineeVetter) external onlyGovernance {
247:         address oldNomineeVetter = nomineeVetter;
248:         nomineeVetter = _nomineeVetter;
249:         emit NomineeVetterChanged(oldNomineeVetter, _nomineeVetter);
250:     }
```

### 3. Use named parameters for mapping type declarations

Consider using named parameters in mappings (e.g. mapping(address account => uint256 balance)) to improve readability. This feature is present since Solidity 0.8.18

``` solidity
KeyValueStore.sol
7:    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public store;

SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol
19:   mapping(address => uint256) votesUsed;
24:   mapping(address => uint240) weightReceived;

SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol
55:   mapping(address => bool) isContender;
56:   mapping(address => bool) isExcluded;

SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol
19:   mapping(address => uint256) votesUsed;
20:   mapping(address => uint256) votesReceived;
22:   mapping(address => bool) isNominee;
```

### 4. consider using code duplication to make the code shorter

``` diff
SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernorTiming.sol
75: function electionToTimestamp(uint256 electionIndex) public view returns (uint256) {
76:         // subtract one to make month 0 indexed
-77:         uint256 month = firstNominationStartDate.month - 1;
78: 
-79:         month += 6 * electionIndex;
-80:         uint256 year = firstNominationStartDate.year + month / 12;
-81:         month = month % 12;
82: 
83:         // add one to make month 1 indexed
-84:         month += 1;
85: 
+require(electionIndex < MAX_ELECTIONS, "Invalid election index");

+uint256 month = (firstNominationStartDate.month + 6 * electionIndex - 1) % 12 + 1;
+uint256 year = firstNominationStartDate.year + (firstNominationStartDate.month + 6 * electionIndex - 1) / 12;

86:         return DateTimeLib.dateTimeToTimestamp({
87:             year: year,
88:             month: month,
89:             day: firstNominationStartDate.day,
90:             hour: firstNominationStartDate.hour,
91:             minute: 0,
92:             second: 0
93:         });
94:     }

```


### 5. update solidity version 0.8.16 to 0.8.20

This compiler switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not yet support PUSH0, otherwise, deployment of your contracts will fail.
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?color=light#setting-the-evm-version-to-target

ALL CONTRACT

### 6. consider bitwise shift to combine weight[i] with index i

added validation to check for data type constraints, using uint240 for weights in the selectTopNominees function, which means values ​​will not exceed uint240 limits.
191: uint240[] memory weights

``` solidity

SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol
204: 
205:         for (uint16 i = 0; i < nominees.length; i++) {
206:             uint256 packed = (uint256(weights[i]) << 16) | i;
207: 
208:             if (topNomineesPacked[0] < packed) {
209:                 topNomineesPacked[0] = packed;
210:                 LibSort.insertionSort(topNomineesPacked);
211:             }
212:         }
213: 
214:         address[] memory topNomineesAddresses = new address[](k);
215:         for (uint16 i = 0; i < k; i++) {
216:             topNomineesAddresses[i] = nominees[uint16(topNomineesPacked[i])];
217:         }
218: 

```

### 7. Consider Verify the userSignature digital using ECDSA on the election.isContender

    as an example
    address recoveredAddress = recoverSigner(userSignature);
    require(recoveredAddress == msg.sender, "Invalid user signature");

``` solidity 
SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.sol
218:     function addContender(uint256 proposalId) external {
219:         ElectionInfo storage election = _elections[proposalId];
220: 
221:         if (election.isContender[msg.sender]) {
222:             revert AlreadyContender(msg.sender);
223:         }
224: 
225:         ProposalState state_ = state(proposalId);
226:         if (state_ != ProposalState.Active) {
227:             revert ProposalNotActive(state_);
228:         }
229: 
230:         // check to make sure the contender is not part of the other cohort (the cohort not currently up for election)
231:         // this only checks against the current the current other cohort, and against the current cohort membership
232:         // in the security council, so changes to those will mean this check will be inconsistent.
233:         // this check then is only a relevant check when the elections are running as expected - one at a time,
234:         // every 6 months. Updates to the sec council manager using methods other than replaceCohort can effect this check
235:         // and it's expected that the entity making those updates understands this.
236:         if (securityCouncilManager.cohortIncludes(otherCohort(), msg.sender)) {
237:             revert AccountInOtherCohort(otherCohort(), msg.sender);
238:         }
239: 
240:         election.isContender[msg.sender] = true;
241: 
242:         emit ContenderAdded(proposalId, msg.sender);
243:     }
```
