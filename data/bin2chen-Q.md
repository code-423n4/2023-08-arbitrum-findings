L-01: requireSafesEquivalent() Lack of checking if GnosisSafe's Modules are safe
in `SecurityCouncilMgmtUpgradeLib.requireSafesEquivalent()`， For security reasons, it is checked that the new and old `GnosisSafe` owners are the same.
```solidity
    function requireSafesEquivalent(
        IGnosisSafe _safe1,
        IGnosisSafe safe2,
        uint256 _expectedThreshold
    ) internal view {
        uint256 newSecurityCouncilThreshold = safe2.getThreshold();
        require(
            _safe1.getThreshold() == newSecurityCouncilThreshold,
            "SecurityCouncilMgmtUpgradeLib: threshold mismatch"
        );
        require(
            newSecurityCouncilThreshold == _expectedThreshold,
            "SecurityCouncilMgmtUpgradeLib: unexpected threshold"
        );

        address[] memory prevOwners = _safe1.getOwners();
        address[] memory newOwners = safe2.getOwners();
        require(
@>          areAddressArraysEqual(prevOwners, newOwners),
            "SecurityCouncilMgmtUpgradeLib: owners mismatch"
        );
    }
```

So far only the two `Owners()` have been checked to see if they are the same, but not check the `Modules` of `GnosisSafe`.
Since `Modules` have high privileges and can modify `owners` at will
So we also need to make sure that the `Modules` are the same or that the `Modules` of the new `GnosisSafe` are empty, to avoid `owner()` being modified.

suggest:
Check if both `Modules` are the same or the `Modules` of the new `GnosisSafe` are empty.

L-02: `SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.includeNominee()` Failure to check if `account` is address(0) may cause `Election` to be blocked

When `Nominee` is less than 6, `NomineeVetter` can execute `includeNominee()` to replenish the number to 6

```solidity
    function includeNominee(uint256 proposalId, address account) external onlyNomineeVetter {
        ProposalState state_ = state(proposalId);
        if (state_ != ProposalState.Succeeded) {
            revert ProposalNotSucceededState(state_);
        }
        
        if (isNominee(proposalId, account)) {
            revert NomineeAlreadyAdded(account);
        }

        uint256 cnCount = compliantNomineeCount(proposalId);
        uint256 cohortSize = securityCouncilManager.cohortSize();
        if (cnCount >= cohortSize) {
            revert CompliantNomineeTargetHit(cnCount, cohortSize);
        }
        if (securityCouncilManager.cohortIncludes(otherCohort(), account)) {
                revert AccountInOtherCohort(otherCohort(), account);
        }
    }
```

From the above method we can see that `includeNominee()` does not determine if `account` is `address(0)` or not
If `NomineeVetter` is being held hostage
After maliciously adding a new `Nominee==address(0)` and rounding up to 6 people, immediately execute `SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.execute()` to complete the voting

Since there are only 6 people and one is included as `address(0)`, `SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor`'s `propose` in this round is blocked
Because `address(0)` cannot execute `securityCouncilManager.replaceCohort()`
When one round of Member Election is blocked, all subsequent Election will also be stuck

Suggestion.

Add a judgment
```solidity
    function includeNominee(uint256 proposalId, address account) external onlyNomineeVetter {
+       require(account!=address(0),"invalid account");
        ProposalState state_ = state(proposalId);
....
    }
```


L-03: selectTopNominees() When the number of votes is the same, the ordering doesn't make sense.

in `SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor.selectTopNominees()`，In calculating the maximum number of 6 votes, will accumulates `i`

```solidity
    function selectTopNominees(address[] memory nominees, uint240[] memory weights, uint256 k)
        public
        pure
        returns (address[] memory)
    {
        if (nominees.length != weights.length) {
            revert LengthsDontMatch(nominees.length, weights.length);
        }
        if (nominees.length < k) {
            revert NotEnoughNominees(nominees.length, k);
        }

        uint256[] memory topNomineesPacked = new uint256[](k);

        for (uint16 i = 0; i < nominees.length; i++) {
@>          uint256 packed = (uint256(weights[i]) << 16) | i;

@>          if (topNomineesPaacked[0] < packed) {
                topNomineesPacked[0] = packed;
                LibSort.insertionSort(topNomineesPacked);
            }
        }
```

This leads to the problem that when two people have the same number of votes, the candidate who reaches `0.2%` first will loses, because the `i` of the person who reaches `0.2%` first is smaller, and the `packed` is smaller.

This ordering does not make sense, it is logical that the first to reach `0.2%` should be prioritized higher.

Suggestion.
For `packed` use `i` in reverse order, e.g..`uint256 packed = (uint256(weights[i]) << 16) | (10000 - i);`
